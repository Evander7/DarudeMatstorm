# DarudeMatstorm
Darude dankstorm, made in MatLab
The song 'Sandstorm', by Darude, has received a new wave of popularity on the internet over the past few years.
While having a look at other bits of music made in Matlab, I was inspired to give Sandstorm the Matlab touch.

I have no musical skill, and did not quite know how to even begin making this.
I learned that each note is just a sinusoidal wave, which can be created by sin(omega*t), where omega= 2*pi*frequency
By creating a whole host of variables, each with a different frequency, I was able to make notes.
And by adding those sinusoidal waves on top of one another, I was able to create chords - multiple notes played at once.
And by passing these variables to Matlab's soundsc() function, I am able to make music!
I started looking for sheet music for Matlab, learning what the corresponding notes were and slowly transcribing them, before 
then putting them into my programme.
I've encountered a number of problems, the biggest probably being the fact parts of it don't sound as close to the original as I would have liked.
It is hard to accurately recreate a song on your own, when creating it from scratch, and especially when playing it in a programming language.
I haven't added any harmonics or anything, so it doesn't sound like any real instrument, nor do I have the required musical knowledge to make it sound more life-like 
or closer to the original. I also had to leave out a lot of synthesised sound and background to the song.
I like the way it sounds, though. It gives a bit of uniqueness to it. It's how the instrument of Matlab sounds, and in the end, I'm very happy with it.

This is not Darude Sandstorm. It does not sound exactly like the song you're used to.
It is instead Darude MatStorm. Played on an entirely new instrument- MatLab!.

Please note: I have experienced this sounding slightly different depending on the machine/audio equipment running the programme.
My only guess is that it is slightly dependant on the sound card present in the machine, and potentially a host of other
machine-specific reasons?
It is for this reason I have attached an audio recording of what the programme sounds like to me, on my laptop, so that in case it does not work out
exactly as planned, you can still get to experience it.

Please enjoy, and thank you for giving it a listen
